## About Me

Seasoned Agile coach and practitioner as well as operation and project manager with more than 15 years building startups and restructuring companies, improving processes, empowering teams and delivering innovative products in resource-constrained environments.

Originally from [Saguenay](https://goo.gl/maps/dYYPR41LM322) I have moved to [Montreal](https://goo.gl/maps/ChPnhgTk4eH2) in 2004 and then to [Barbados](https://goo.gl/maps/FUwPnEMskaM2) in 2014 to eventually come back to my hometown where I live with my wife Virginie since 2019. When I'm not travelling the world slightly off the beaten track, I enjoy hiking, biking, rock climbing and to savor good local products in great company.
