## About Me

Seasoned operation and project manager with more than 10 years building startups and restructuring companies, improving processes, empowering teams and delivering innovative products in resource-constrained environments.

Originally from [Saguenay](https://goo.gl/maps/dYYPR41LM322) I have moved to [Montreal](https://goo.gl/maps/ChPnhgTk4eH2) in 2004 and then to [Barbados](https://goo.gl/maps/FUwPnEMskaM2) where I live with my wife Virginie since 2014. When I'm not travelling the world slightly off the beaten track, I enjoy outdoor water sports, hiking, biking and to savor good local products in great company.
