# Credits and friends...  
## Welcome to the Backstage of My Personal Website!

This website is made by myself with love, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted for free on [Gihthub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and served over [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).  
**Disclaimer**: I'm really not considering myself as a coder but I've tried as much as possible to follow the web best practices.  
The options I have chosen during the creation of this website have been based on the following:

 - Strong Open-Source Distributions: The tools and softwares have to be open-source and well suported by their development community.  
 - Without Plugin: The Jekyll website has to keep its ability to be built (and hosted) by GitHub Pages (No disalowed plugin).  
 - Free: The 3rd party services have to be at no cost (at least for personal usage).  
 - Simplicity: The simpliest way that follow the best standards and conventions.  
 - Fast: It must score as high as possible on [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights), [Pindom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com) and [GTmetirx](https://gtmetrix.com).
 - Compliant: It must comply with the international and local laws, including best privacy practices.  
  
  
Current speed performances: Google PageSpeed 89/100, Pindom Website Speed Test: 94 grade, GTmetirx 95%
