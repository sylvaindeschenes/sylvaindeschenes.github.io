# Credits and friends...  
## Welcome to the Backstage of My Personal Website!

This website is made by myself with love, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), designed with [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com), hosted on [Gihthub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and served over [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).  
**Disclaimer**: I'm really not considering myself as a coder but I've tried as much as possible to follow the web best practices.  
The options I have chosen during the creation of this website have been based on the following:

 - Free: The site, its hosting and all 3rd party services have to be at no cost (at least for personal usage).  
 - Open-Source: The tools and softwares have to be strong open-source distribtions well suported by their development community.  
 - Simple: The simpliest way that follow the best practices, standards and conventions.  
 - Without Plugin: The Jekyll website has to keep its ability to be built (and hosted) by GitHub Pages (No disalowed plugin).  
 - Fast: It must score as high as possible on the most popular web speed tests.
 - Compliant: It must comply with the international and local laws, including best privacy practices.  
  
Speed performances:  

 - [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsylvaind.me%2F): 99/100 Mobile 95/100 Desktop
 - [Pindom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com/#!/cYzTW0/https://sylvaind.me): 95 grade
 - [GTmetirx](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/sylvaind.me/E5kdVdxH): 97%
