## How we process your data
This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [Gihthub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and served over [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).  

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It automaticaly generate a website made entirely of static assets. Meanning, there is no data-base involved in serving the Website to the visitor (so no data can be stored at all on the Website server).  
  
Github (like any hosting company) and Cloudflare (like any CDN and DNS company), can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github and Cloudflare are not known to actively profile visitors.  

## Types of Cookies we use on this Site and Why
We use cookies to determine Site traffic, to personalize any future visits you make to the Site and for security purpose.

### What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below. We update this list semi-yearly, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Sites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.

#### Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses, use SSL at all time and we have agreed a Data Processing Amendment with Google. These measures were taken from a derective of the CBP (Dutch Institute for Privacy Protection) from March 2013 on how to legally use Google Analytics while not showing a cookie warning.  
  
#### Cloudflare
The __cfduid cookie is used to identify individual clients behind a shared IP address and apply security settings on a per-client basis. For example, if the visitor is in a coffee shop where there are a bunch of infected machines, but the specific visitor's machine is trusted (e.g. because they've completed a challenge within your Challenge Passage period), the cookie allows us to identify that client and not challenge them again. It does not correspond to any user ID in your web application, and does not store any personally identifiable information.  **This cookie is created weither or not you approve third party cookies and scripts**, it's strictly necessary for Cloudflare's security features and cannot be turned off. We transmit it using SSL at all time.
