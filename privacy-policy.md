## How we process your data
This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [Gihthub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and served over [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).  

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It automaticaly generate a website made entirely of static assets. Meanning, there is no data-base involved in serving the Website to the visitor (so no data can be stored at all on the Website server).  
  
Github (like any hosting company) and Cloudflare (like any CDN and DNS company), can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github and Cloudflare are not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.  
  
## Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses, use SSL at all time and we have agreed a Data Processing Amendment with Google. These measures were taken from a derective of the CBP (Dutch Institute for Privacy Protection) from March 2013 on how to legally use Google Analytics while not showing a cookie warning.  
  
## Cloudflare
The __cfduid cookie is used to identify individual clients behind a shared IP address and apply security settings on a per-client basis. For example, if the visitor is in a coffee shop where there are a bunch of infected machines, but the specific visitor's machine is trusted (e.g. because they've completed a challenge within your Challenge Passage period), the cookie allows us to identify that client and not challenge them again. It does not correspond to any user ID in your web application, and does not store any personally identifiable information.  **This cookie is created weither or not you approve third party cookies and scripts**, it's strictly necessary for Cloudflare's security features and cannot be turned off. We transmit it using SSL at all time. 

## Contact form
This cookie is used by us for the contact form to keep the values you have filled but not submited yet. The script places a serialized cookie on your computer with all fields. **This cookie is created when you visit another page than the one with the Contact form, weither or not you approve third party cookies and scripts.**
